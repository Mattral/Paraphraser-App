# Text Paraphrasing and Analysis Tool

This repository contains a Streamlit app designed to analyze and paraphrase text documents. It supports text input directly or via file uploads (PDF, DOCX, or TXT files). The app provides valuable metrics such as reading time, readability score, lexical diversity, and sentence count, both for the original and paraphrased text.

## Features

- **Text Analysis**: Analyze text to determine reading time, readability, lexical diversity, and number of sentences.
- **File Upload**: Supports uploading TXT, PDF, and DOCX files for analysis and paraphrasing.
- **Text Paraphrasing**: Utilizes round-trip translation (English to French to German and back to English) to paraphrase text.
- **Easy Copy**: Users can easily copy the paraphrased text from a text area.

## Installation

To run this app locally, you need to have Python installed on your computer (Python 3.6+ is recommended). Follow these steps to get the app running:

1. **Clone the Repository**
